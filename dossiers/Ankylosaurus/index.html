                <p>
                    The Ankylosaurus was a prehistoric tank &mdash; an armored dinosaur with a club-like protrusion at
                    the
                    end of its tail,
                    weighing over 3000kg and measuring over 6m in length.<sup>[<a href="#Source-01">1</a>]</sup>The top
                    of
                    the dinosaur was
                    covered with thick
                    armor made up of large knobs and oval plates of bone called osteoderms or scutes, giving the
                    Ankylosaurus a very rugged appearance;
                    osteoderms are also present on crocodiles and armadillos. These plates, probably covered in skin and
                    keratin, were aligned in
                    horizontal rows down the neck, back, and hips of the dinosaur, also covering the end of the
                    dinosaur's
                    tail to create a club.
                    Smaller plates of armor between larger plates as well as possibly having plates on its limbs and
                    tail
                    further fortified the Ankylosaurus.
                    Offering additional protection were 2 rows of spikes down the body, horns projecting back and to the
                    side, plates covering the animal&#8217;s eyes,
                    and a flat body low to the ground. The animal's large skull was equipped with a narrow beak and
                    leaf-shaped teeth, and its hind limbs were
                    slightly longer than those in the front. These characteristics created the unique appearance of the
                    Ankylosaurus, easily recognizable by its
                    armored body and tail club.<sup>[<a href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup>

                <h3>Habitat & Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Cretaceous Period, North America was divided by the Western Interior Seaway, with the
                    island
                    continent of Laramdia to the west
                    and the landmass of Appalachia to the east. The Ankylosaurus inhabited Laramdia, which became
                    present-day western North America.<sup>[<a href="#Source-03">3</a>]</sup>
                    The Ankylosaurus&#8217; range stretched across western North America, with fossils found between
                    Alberta
                    and Wyoming.
                    The armored dinosaur lived in a terrestrial environment. It resided in the woodlands, plains,
                    and grasslands that received the abundant rainfall necessary to sustain its diet of greens as a
                    herbivore.<sup>[<a href="#Source-01">1</a>]</sup>
                    Ankylosauruses may have lived in environments away from rivers and swamps conducive to
                    fossilization,
                    which could possibly explain why their fossils are so rare.<sup>[<a href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup>

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    The Ankylosaurus was a herbivore. Because of its stature, it grazed on low-lying plants &mdash; up
                    to
                    60kg a day, which is as much as a large elephant.<sup>[<a href="#Source-04">4</a>]</sup>
                    Their diet likely included ferns, cycads, shrubs, leaves, and fruit within their reach. The
                    Ankylosaurus
                    was well adapted to its herbivorous lifestyle.
                    Its triangular skull housed a narrow beak at the end which aided in stripping leaves from the plants
                    it
                    ate on a daily basis.
                    The small leaf-shaped teeth of the dinosaur could not break apart large plants and it also had no
                    grinding teeth.
                    Its large belly, however, indicates that the Ankylosaurus had an elaborate, possibly
                    fermentation-based
                    stomach system
                    to break down all of the unchewed plants it ate.<sup>[<a href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup>Furthermore,
                    Ankylosaurus&#8217; fossils
                    seem to indicate that
                    it had a large brain structure dedicated to smell, possibly allowing it to use its sense of smell
                    when
                    finding food.<sup>[<a href="#Source-05">5</a>]</sup>
                    Analysis of its skull also suggests that the dinosaur's nostrils were placed at the side of its
                    head,
                    which may have served an evolutionary purpose to its diet or sense of smell.<sup>[<a

                    Although Juvenile Ankylosaurus likely lived in congregation for collective security,<sup>[<a
                            href="#Source-07">7</a>]</sup> adult
                    Ankylosauruses likely lived a slow-moving solitary lifestyle,
                    only meeting with other members of their species to mate. Their heavy, tank-like body paired with
                    their
                    short limbs made for a less than ideal combination when it
                    comes to long-distance walking in herds. Furthermore, an adult Ankylosaurus would be more than
                    capable
                    of defending itself against larger predators with its
                    armored body and tail club.<sup>[<a href="#Source-08">8</a>]</sup>.When the Ankylosaurus did meet
                    each
                    other to mate, the use of
                    their tail clubs in breeding is disputed by scientists.
                    The formidable weapon may have been used to simply attract mates but could have also been used to
                    fight
                    for mating rights/territory in addition to
                    its role of protection against predators.<sup>[<a href="#Source 02">2</a>]</sup>How the
                    Ankylosauruses
                    communicated is also
                    unknown, but its complex sinus and nasal cavities,
                    among other things like lightening weight or housing a nasal gland, could have been used for
                    vocalization.<sup>[<a href="#Source-09">9</a>]</sup>

                <h3>Life History Cycle</h3>
                <p>
                    Like all dinosaurs, the Ankylosaurus began its life as an egg, but its growth and development from
                    this
                    point forward is largely unknown.
                    However, studies of Ankylosaurs offer insight into the growth and development of Ankylosauruses. A
                    mixture of woven and parallel fibered
                    bone paired with overall poor development of blood vessels in organs or parts indicates growth rates
                    slower than other dinosaurs in Ankylosaurs.
                    Additionally, Ankylosaurs substitute large amounts of their primary tissue early in their
                    development.
                    This anomaly could be linked to late
                    formation of bone in their body armor.<sup>[<a href="#Source-10">10</a>]</sup>Peculiar finds like
                    the
                    ones mentioned
                    complicate the process of predicting the
                    growth patterns of these dinosaurs, but their estimated lifespans are about 70-80 years old.<sup>[<a
                            href="#Source-11">11</a>]</sup>
                    Once fully grown,
                    the Ankylosaurus measured 6m-6.5m in length and weighed between 3000kg-4000kg. The girth of its
                    stomach
                    was 1.5m, which was its widest part,
                    while its hips cleared the ground by about 1.7m, which was the tallest portion of its body. An adult
                    skull was wider than it was long,
                    at 25 inches in length and 29 inches in width. Taken together, these features made the Ankylosaurus
                    the
                    largest known Ankylosaurid.<sup>[<a href="#Source-01">1</a>]</sup>

                <p>
                    The Ankylosaurus lived during the late Cretaceous Period (about 65 - 68 million years ago). The
                    dinosaur
                    shared its environment with 2 of the most well-known dinosaurs,
                    the T-rex and the triceratops. The Ankylosaurus also shared its environment with two well-known
                    herbivores: The Edmontosaurus and
                    the Pachycephalosaurus.<sup>[<a href="#Source-12">12</a>]</sup>Carnivorous dinosaurs, most notably
                    the
                    Tyrannosaurus and Deinonychus
                    were known to be natural enemies of the Ankylosaurus.<sup>[<a href="#Source-13">13</a>]</sup>
                    However,
                    it is possible that these
                    dinosaurs would avoid hunting the Ankylosaurus,
                    instead going for easier meals. The dinosaur's heavy armor, tail club, and its rotund, flat body
                    acted
                    as strong deterrents.
                    Flipping the Ankylosaurus to expose its soft underbelly was likely the only way for predators to
                    defeat
                    the formidable dinosaur.

                <h3>Fossils</h3>
                <p>
                    A team of paleontologists led by Barnum Brown discovered the first fossils of the Ankylosaurus in
                    the
                    Hell Creek Formation of Montana in 1906.
                    This find included ribs, vertebrae, the top of a skull, armor, and a shoulder girdle piece.<sup>[<a
                            href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup> However,
                    Osteoderms previously found by Brown in the Lance Formation of Wyoming during the year 1900 are
                    believed
                    to belong
                    to the Ankylosaurus instead of belonging to the Dynamosaurus, with whom the osteoderms were first
                    associated.
                    No complete Ankylosaurus skeleton has ever been found, with only 5 major specimens discovered when
                    excluding isolated bones, armor, and teeth.
                    These 5 specimens, which include Brown's holotype, are the main resource for studies on the
                    Ankylosaurus
                    as they each contain rare and important
                    parts of its skeleton.<sup>[<a href="#Source-14">14</a>]</sup> The dinosaur had fused bones in its
                    skull
                    and other parts of its
                    body to provide extra strength, which is why its name means “fused lizard” in Greek. Like the
                    osteoderms
                    of all ankylosaurs,
                    the Ankylosaurus&#8217; osteoderms were made up of a thin compact bone on top of a thicker inner
                    bone
                    that is spongy and porous.
                    The dinosaur's tail had vertebrae woven together, forming a stiff rod at the base of its
                    characteristic
                    tail club.
                    Examination of the Ankylosaurus fossils also reveals that the neck was the most heavily armored
                    region
                    on the dinosaur.<sup>[<a href="#Source-15">15</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup>
