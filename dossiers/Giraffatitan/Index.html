                <h2> Fossil Record & Identification</h2>
                <p>  The Giraffatitan had a similar body to a giraffe with longer legs<br> and a much longer neck.
                    “ The skull had a tall arch anterior to the eyes,<br> consisting of the bony nares, a number of
                     other openings, and ‘spatulate’ teeth,<br> like chisels.”  The first toe on the front feet as
                      well as the first three toes<br> on the back feet had claws. There are very few recorded fossils
                       of <br> the Giraffatitan.  There are five partial skeletons, three skulls, and many<br> fragments of
                        skull material, bones, vertebrae, and teeth.

                <h2> Giraffatitan Discovery</h2>
                <p>The Giraffatitan was discovered and named in 1914 by<br>
                     Werner Janensch at a German mining site in Tanzania<br>
                      where several specimens were recovered.</p>

                <h2>Feeding & Adaptations</h2>
                <p> The Giraffatitan were herbivores, it is estimated that they<br>
                     needed to eat more than 400 lbs of food per day to sustain<br>
                      themselves.  They were able to reach higher trees than other<br>
                       plant eating dinosaurs thanks to their longer neck and legs.<br>
                       Its front legs were longer than its hind legs<br>
                     so that it could reach even higher altitudes.</p>
