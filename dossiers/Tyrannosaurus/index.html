                    It also allowed Tyrannosaurus rexes to find prey easily.

                <h2 class="title">Diet</h2>
                <p>Food was easy to find for Tyrannosaurus Rexes. Tyrannosaurus rex usually live in big forests near
                    rivers. They chose rivers because they knew that there would be prey hanging around rivers to
                    try
                    and take a drink of water. The tyrannosaurus rex would then grab the prey out of mid-air to eat.
                    Because of their substantial teeth, they often hunted for herbivorous dinosaurs. This made them have
                    a population of around 1.7 billion Tyrannosaurus rexes during the Ceratourous era. With that
                    many
                    Tyrannosaurus rexes, they needed to learn how to properly live. <sup><a href="#Source-5">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                    A normal lifestyle of a Tyrannosaurus Rex is a little bit more complicated than
                    what most people
                    know about these types of dinosaurs. Although they had a big size and sharp teeth, they had to deal
                    with potential predators that are quick and able to attack them easily, even their own kind aren't
                    friendly towards each other. As a result, they would often be put in packs so they were able to look
                    out for each other incase of potential danger. The reason we know all of these things is because of
                    a famous fossil hunter.

                <p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex wasn't discovered until we hit the early 1900s when a man named Barnum Brown
                    first
                    discovered the fossil when Brown was leading his normal expedition. Having experience in the
                    American
                    Museum
                    of Natural History, Brown decided to go to Hell Creek Formation in Montana, then he dug up what
                    is
                    believed
                    to be the first documented evidence of the Tyrannosaurus Rex.<sup><a href="#Source-06">4</a></sup>

                    scream. Although this is partly true, most Tyrannosaurus Rex often communicate via tiny “coos” and

                <p>Besides Tyrannosaurus Rexes living in packs and often getting into altercation with each other, they
                    didn't live as long as other dinosaurs, often lasting about 28 years. They were often born in
                    elongated
                    eggs, having around 20 baby T-rexes. They often died to natural causes instead of dinosaurs because
                    of
