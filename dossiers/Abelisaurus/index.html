            <h2>Classification of Abelisaurus</h2>
            <p>Abelisaurus is a genus of predatory Abelisaurid Theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late
                Cretaceous Period (Campaina) of what is now South America. It's a carnivorus dinosaur. It
                lived in 75-70 million years ago. The genus was named by Jose Bonaparte and Fenando Emilio
                Novas in 1985, and the type species is Abelisaurus comahuensis. Abelisaurus belongs to the
                family Abelisauridae, subfamily Camnofaurinae, and infraorder Ceratosauria. It is classified
                under the suborder large Theropods, class Reptilia, kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, order
                Saurischia, and superorder Dinosauria.</p>

            <p>Abelisaurus is a type of dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous
                Period, specifically in the Campanian stage or forest, which lasted from
                approximately 75 to 70 million years ago. During this period, the Earth
                was warm and humid, with high sea levels and a tropical climate. </p>

            <p>Abelisaurus probably ate large sauropod dinosaurs. It may also have hunted

            <p>Although only one partial skull of Abelisaurus has been found, it is estimated that the
                dinosaur was between 7 to 9 meters (25 to 30 feet) long and weighed roughly 3 to 4 tons. The
                size of the dinosaur is uncertain as it is known from only one partial skull. In 2016, a
                comprehensive of Abelisaur size estimated its length to be 7 to 9 meters (24 feet - 30
                feet). The skull length was estimated at 24 inches in 1985.</p>

            <h2>Distribution</h2>
            <p>The dinosaur was discovered in Argentina, in an area known as Patagonia . The fossil was
                found in the Anacleto Formation between 83 and 80 million years ago . Locally Abelisaurus is
                known to have come from the Sr. Fernandez field, which is in the Campanian Allen Formation,
                which makes its stratigraphic position unclear . Most abelisaurids were found in Madagascar,
                Asia, or sometimes in Africa. Abelisauridae thrived during the Cretaceous period, on the
                ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana, and today their fossil remains are found on the
                modern continents of Africa and South America.</p>

            <p>Abelisaurus fossils were discovered by Argentine paleontologists José Bonaparte and
                Fernando Emilio Novas in 1985. The type species, Abelisaurus comahuensis, was named by
                Roberto Abel. The fossil was found in the Anacleto Formation of Rio Negro Province,
                Argentina. The skull of Abelisaurus is incomplete, especially on the right side, and
                most of the connections between the snout and the back of the skull are absent. Despite
                this, it could be estimated to be over 85 centimeters long.</p>

            <h2>Behaviors and Adaptions</h2>
            <p>It is believed to have been an aggressive predator that was skilled at taking down
                large prey. Paleontologists think that they may have hunted in packs because several
                individuals had been discovered in the same location. Abelisaurus probably used its
                sharp teeth and long, narrow head to slice and tear chunks of flesh from their
                victims. It is also possible that they may have scavenged for food when necessary.

            <h2>Fossil Description</h2>
            <p> It consists of a skull, lacking the lower jaws, that is incomplete,
                especially on the right side. Most of the connections between the snout and
                the back of the skull are absent. It is also missing most of the palate
                (roof of the mouth). It had a large head with small teeth and openings in
                its skull above the jaws. The holes, called “fenestrae,” were likely evolved
                to lighten the weight of this dinosaur’s massive head, which otherwise might
                have unbalanced its entire body. Abelisaurus was bipedal and had fairly
                short arms.</p>
