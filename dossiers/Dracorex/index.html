                <h3>Fun Fact</h3>

                <p>The Dracorex is also called the Dracorex Hogwarsia<sup><a href="#source-08">8</a></sup>, which means
                    dragon king of Hogwarts. Although the
                    Dracorex Hogwartsia is an interesting name, it is not a new species but a juvenile of
                    Pachycepalorsaurus<sup><a href="#source-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Size</h3>

                <p>They were about 15 to 21 feet long as an adult, which is about the length of 2 cars. They reached a
                    height of 4 feet. An adult Dracorex
                    also weighed about 1000 pounds<sup><a href="#source-06">6</a></sup>.

            <section>
                <h3>Time Period</h3>
                <p>They live in the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous. This was about 72 to 66 million years
                    ago<sup><a href="#source-10">10</a></sup>.
                    This was the last age od Cretaceous period before the new Paleogene period.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>The Pachycephalosaurus was a herbivore. Their diet consisted of fruits, leaves and seeds<sup><a
                            href="#source-17">17</a></sup>. Some
                    scientists believed
                    that the Pachycephalosaurus might have been an omnivore because of their sharp teeth which resemble
                    carnivore teeth.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Predators</h3>
                <p>The Tyrannosaur<sup><a href="#source-16">16</a></sup> was one of the Pachycephalosaurus predators.
                    The Tyrannosaur was 40 feet long and 12
                    feet tall. The Pachycephalosaurus could not do anything against the Tyrannosaur. Another predator
                    that they had to deal with was the velociraptor. They were 5.5 feet long and 1.6 feet tall. The
                    Pachycephalosaurus lived in a herd whiched helped with defending themselves against Velociraptors.

            <section>
                <h3>Identification</h3>
                <p>They could easily be identified by their unique bone dome on their head. They are also bipedal<sup><a
                            href="#source-16">16</a></sup>, which
                    means that they walk on two feet. They were about 15 to 21 feet long as an adult and they reached a
                    height of 4 feet.</p>

                    <h2>Fossil Record</h2>
                    <p>The fossils were found in the layer of upper Creteceous rock<sup><a
                                href="#source-14">14</a></sup>. The layer was mostly made out of
                        sandstones and siltstone. There was also conglomerate, shale, mudstone, and porcelanite.

                    <h2>Fossil Description</h2>
                    <p>Their fossils were easily recognizable because of their unique features on their heads. They had
                        a
                        bone dome on their head which was unique to their species. Their skull was 30 times thicker than
                        a human skull<sup><a href="#source-13">13</a></sup>. They also had small triangular teeth,
                        which scientists suspected that they might have eaten meat. Nevertheless they were herbivores.

                    <h2>Who Discovered It and When</h2>
                    <p>The fossil of Pachycephalosaurus was discovered by Loren Colman and Robert Bakker<sup><a
                                href="#source-11">11</a></sup>. They
                        discovered
                        the fossil in 2004. The fossils were found in Hell Creek Formation, South Dakota.</p>

                    <p>Pachycephalosaurus lived in forests, grasslands and plains. The habitat had delta river,
                        shrubs,
                        woodlands, ferns and ponds. The ecosystem was shared with invertebrates, birds, reptiles,
                        and
                        amphibians. This habitat was great for the Pachycephalosaurus because it was filled with
                        luscious
                        vegetation which they ate. Their predators also inhabited the same environment like the
                        tyrannosaurus rex<sup><a href="#source-17">17</a></sup>, velociraptor,
                        carnotaurus,
                        and
                        allosaurus.

                <p>
                    The Pachycepalorsaurus used to roam around what is now North America. To be more precise they
                    lived in the province of Alberta<sup><a href="#source-07">7</a></sup>, Canada and in the North of
                    the West and Midwest states of the
                    United States. The figure below shows an image of Canada and the United States.

                    communicate<sup><a href="#Source-05">5</a></sup>.
                    Sometimes they get physical to communicate with each other. This usually happens during mating

                <p>They live in a herd to protect the juvenile Pachycephalosaurus against predators. When a predator
                    threatens a juvenile Pachycephalosaurus they use their dome head to head butt the predators.
                    They
                    are
                    usually passive creatures but they show they become agressive when mating season comes or to show
                    dominance to become herd leader<sup><a href="#source-12">12</a></sup>.

                <h2>Breeding Behavior</h2>
                <p>The Pachycephalosaurus is similar to some animals like Bighorn sheep. They used their bone dome
                    head
                    to
                    show superiority by head butting another one of their species in the flank<sup><a
                            href="#source-07">7</a></sup>. This only happens
                    during
                    mating season for male to court mates.

            <section>
                <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
                <p>The Pachycephalosaurus starts off as an egg. Then they break out of their egg and become a
                    hatchling.
                    After a while they grow up to be a juvenile. As they grow older their skull gets thicker. When they
                    become adults their skull will reach a thickness of about 10 inches<sup><a
                            href="#source-09">9</a></sup> and the
                    cycle
                    repeats.
