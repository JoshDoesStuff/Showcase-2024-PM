            <h1>The Rugops</h1>

            


            <h2>Genus</h2>
            <p>The Rugops is a certain genus of dinosaur. You may be wondering what the word Genus means,
                the definition for the word Genus the usual major subdivision of a family or subfamily in the
                classification
                of organisms, usually consisting of more than one species. The form of genus the rugops is in is
                Taxonomy.
                Taxonomy is a name describing a living organism.

            <h2>Species</h2>
            <p>The species name for the Rugops is wrinkle face. Primus is the species name for the rugops. There are
                over
                700 valid species of dinosaurs that have been discovered and named. For example the most poliar species
                of
                dinosaur
                is the tyrannosaurus rex.

        <h2>Suborder</h2>
        <p>The suborder of the rugops is centosauria. When it comes to explaining the suborder and order this
            descriptive <br> picture (from britanica) can help you understand how the both of them work. As you can see
            from the informative <br> picture you can understand that the suborders branch off from the 2 orders. The
            order
            for the rugops is Saurischia <br> stretching past the mid section and becoming the suborder of Ceratosauria.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>The rugops is in the Abelisauridae family. Abelisauridae is a family of dinosaurs that survived during the
            cretaceous period.The Abelisauridae family has a wide variety of dinosaurs like the Krytops, Genusaurus,
            Xenosaurus, etc. Some of the characteristics of a Abelisauridae is stalky hind legs, and extensive
            orientation
            of the slil and bones with grooves pits.

            <h2>Subphylum</h2>
            <p>A Subphylum is a category that ranks below phylum. The subphylum for the rugops is Centosauria
                Vertebrata.
                Verbrata means a group of animals that have spines. A phylum is a taxonomic category that ranks above
                class
                but under kingdom the phylum of the rupos is Chordata.

            <p>The rugops is in the animalia kingdom. Animalia means animal, the characteristics of an animal are
                something
                that is able to consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, etc.</p>

            <h2>Time period</h2>
            <p>The time period that the rugops lived in was the late cretaceous period. According to the time period,
                jaw,
                and
                build of the rugops, it was a carnivore and due to its weak jaws and tiny arms they ate tiny animals and
                carases.</p>

            <h2>Behaviors and adaptations</h2>
            <p>The rugops were adapted for grasping and manipulating prey and it was probably a scavenger due to its
                weak
                skull.

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>The way the rugops communicated with each other is still unknown to us. But the assumption is that they
                communicate similarly to the way tyrannosaurus rex's communicated, with mumbles and coos. </p>

            <h2>Life cycle</h2>
            <p>The life cycle for the rugops originates from an egg. That means that the reproduction cycle is
                oviparous.

            <h2>Predators</h2>
            <p>There was no information about what the predators are but it can be assumed that going from the
                information
                we
                have judging by the weak jaw that the rugops had and them not being made to attack, they would be hunted
                by
                bigger and stronger animals from the same period that the rugops lived in.

                <h2>Fossil discription</h2>
                <p>A description of the fossil from the rugops was weak and unstable. The skull had small rows of holes
                    which would
                    indicate that they looked like it had its own crest.
