                    <h3>What's A Troodon?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <em>Troodon</em> was a small theropod bird that lived millions of years ago.
                        The name of the Troodon came from the Greek meaning of the “Wound Tooth”, since its teeth are
                        oddly, uniquely shaped. <sup> <a href="#Source-01">[1]</a></sup>
                        The Troodon was a member of the Troodontidae family, who’s order is known to be a Saurischia.
                        They are a part of the suborder known as Theropoda.
                        They were thought to be very intelligent, despite their size which was relatively small, only
                        being 8ft tall and weighing 110 pounds.<sup> <a href="#Source-04">[4]</a></sup>
                        They are thought to belong to the Animalia kingdom who’s phylum is regarded as Chordata, while
                        their subphylum is Dinosauria, Saurischia, and Theropoda.

                                Thought to live over 86 million years ago in the <em>Late Cretaceous period</em>. Some
                                notable dinosaurs that lived in the Late Cretaceous period were: <sup> <a href="#Source-02">[2]</a></sup>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tyrannosaurus</li>
                                <li>Triceratops</li>
                                <li>Velociraptor</li>
                                <li>Ankylosaurus</li>
                                <li>Parasaurolophus</li>
                            </ul>
                                More specifically they lived in what is present day USA: Montana, Texas, New Mexico, Alaska, and
                                found in Alberta, Canada. <sup> <a href="#Source-06">[6]</a></sup> From the information given to us, we think that the Troodon lived in 
                                colder climates and isfound in more colder areas like Northern or Atlantic areas. Sometimes 
                                they can be found in Heilongjiang, China, but most are found in North America in colder regions.

                        <h2>Fossil Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            The fossil of the Troodon looks like a raptor’s fossil. First discovered in 1856 by Joseph
                            Leidy, it was thought that the Troodon was a scavenger.
                            The more we learn about Troodons the more becomes questioned, first that the teeth of the
                            Troodon was a lazard,<sup> <a href="#Source-07">[7]</a></sup>
                            but with more information by 1901 it was then regarded as Megalosauridae.
                            Then some people started to think that the Troodon was a herbivore in 1924, but by 1945,
                            Charles Sternberg argued that the Troodon was a part of the
                            Troodontidae family. In the present day we still believe that it’s a part of the
                            Troodonitdae <sup> <a href="#Source-02">[2]</a></sup> family.

                                The Troodon was thought to have been one of the smartest dinosaurs in their Period,
                                allowing it to think and problem solve a whole lot better than other dinosaurs.
                                We believe that they stood on their hind legs since they would be quick enough to at run
                                one of their predators or fast enough to catch their prey.<sup> <a href="#Source-09">[9]</a></sup>
                                They would also try to cut off their prey or try to outthink their predators. One of the
                                smartest things they figured out was how to hide their young.
                                Since they were a theropod, they laid eggs, so when they went out to hunt for food they
                                would hide these eggs under mud to keep their smell and appearance hidden.
                                It's also believed that the mother would care for the youth and make sure that their
                                eggs are nice and warm.<sup> <a href="#Source-010">[10]</a></sup>
                                Like most animals when the Troodons came of age they would leave their nests and go to
                                find their way in life.

                <h2>Identification</h2>
                <p>
                    The Troodon appears to have had large bulging eyes on a small, slender body that only reaches up to 8ft. 
                    They have 3 claws on each toe and have claws that they used as fingers. <sup> <a href="#Source-03">[3]</a></sup>
                    They even had opposable thumbs like humans, but unlike humans, Troodons had more teeth than the average theropod. 
                    Their teeth appeared to be razor sharp, it mostly helped them cut through the skin of other animals. 
                    They also, like velociraptors, stood on their hind legs. The quality that separates Troodons from other theropods 
                    and most other animals in the Cretaceous Period was its brain. They were regarded as highly intelligent and 
                    might have been able to open doors!

                <h2>Feeding and Hunters</h2>
                <p>
                    Troodon living the Cretaceous Period, had a lot of potential food that they could outsmart or outrun, 
                    especially when they hunted in groups. Troodons are believed to hunt smaller birds and reptiles, 
                    but they would also go after more risky food, like the Amurosaurus. They would try to pick off the young and 
                    would try to avoid the adults. <sup> <a href="#Source-08">[8]</a></sup> If they didn’t feel like hunting or 
                    had no luck at it they could always eat plants.  Troodons were omnivores, meaning they can eat both meat and plants, 
                    but not always where they hunt. Funny enough, other than animals that ate their eggs, the T-Rex and Spinosaurs were the 2 carnivores that 
                    the Troodon had to stay away from.
