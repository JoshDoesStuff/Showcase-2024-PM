                    This dinosaur was around 5 meters to 6 meters long
                    from head to tail and walked on all fours. Gastonia
                    also weighed around a ton when a fully grown adult.<sup>[<a href="#Source-01">1</a>]</sup>
                    Gastonia was armored with a sacral shield and had
                    shoulder spikes for protection on all sides of its
                    back but the total number of spikes on the dinosaur
                    is unknown.<sup>[<a href="#Source-05">5</a>]</sup> The top half of their body (around the
                    head area) had spikes going down from head to tail
                    while getting smaller and smaller the farther down
                    the back and getting duller and duller in the same
                    way until the end of the tail. Gastonia's could
                    headbutt other animals or things because of a
                    mobile brain case for shock absorbance if needed
                    for self defense.

                <p>Gastonias were known to be herding
                    animals and walk with groups of others of
                    the same dinosaur. Gastonia's were also
                    known to be relatively peaceful.
                    Gastonias are herbivores and eat food
                    like leaves, twigs, fruits, and nuts.<sup>[<a href="#Source-08">8</a>]</sup> When it
                    came to communication, the Gastonia
                    would use special sounds or gestures to
                    communicate with other dinosaurs or
                    mates. Speaking of mates, Gastonias
                    would breed and then incubate their eggs
                    until hatched, this sometimes led to the
                    Gastonia being left behind the pack to
                    watch their eggs or sometimes leaving
                    their eggs.   <sup>[<a href="#Source-07">7</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>Gastonia's threat to life was natural
                    disasters and their main predator, the
                    Utahraptor. The Utahraptor would have
                    had to attack the Gastonia for it to flip
                    over on its belly, due to the belly would
                    have no armor or protection and jumping
                    on its back would be not ideal with all the
                    spikes on its back. This would be the only
                    way to get the kill of a Gastonia although
                    the Gastonia would not try to attack
                    because of its stubby legs. Gastonias
                    could defend themselves by headbutting
                    or using their tail to lash at predators.
                    Gastonia could also run away if need be.  <sup>[<a href="#Source-01">1</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>The fossils were found about Gastonia in
                    1998 in Grand County, Utah by James
                    Kirkland. He found said fossils in Yellow
                    Cat Quarry named after Robert Gaston
                    (the founder of the genus). The Gastonia
                    is a very well preserved species and
                    allows for very accurate and easy
                    reconstruction of its body using fossils. It
                    was the first fossil to be mounted in the
                    Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
                    The full body fossil has spikes on its spine
                    and a giant plate located on its lower
                    back (near the tail area). The texture of
                    the fossil was more bumpy and rough,

                <p>Gastonia was a dinosaur in the Early Cretaceous era along with the Triceratops, Irritator
                    and Mosasaurs. It was mostly found living in woodlands, dense forest areas, or swaplands
                    usually with rivers and a lot of brush, in North America. Gastonia would prefer to live near
                    water. This dinosaur lived around what's now called, modern day Utah. <sup>[<a href="#Source-07">7</a>]</sup></p>
