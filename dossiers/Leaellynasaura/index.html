            <p>The Leaellynasaura Amicagraphica, a
                common dinosaur from the Cretaceous
                Period. It’s small in size, about 1 to 2
                meters, and eats vegetation as a food
                source. Inhabited Australia, and had
                sharp teeth and claws, but a rather weird
                head as the seed-shaped beak sprouted from its
                snout, and was feathery or furry like a bird <sup>[<a

            <h2>Habitat and History</h2>
            <p> Founded in Australia, Victoria, by Michelle
                Colwell. She was in a group and on a dig run
                <sup>[<a
                        href="https://australian.museum/learn/dinosaurs/fact-sheets/leaellynasaura-amicagraphica/">1</a>]</sup>.
                The Leaellynasaura also inferred an ancient
                rift between Antarctica and Australia during the
                Cretaceous periods <sup>[<a
                        href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/article/new-smallbodied-ornithopods-dinosauria-neornithischia-from-the-early-cretaceous-wonthaggi-formation-strzelecki-group-of-the-australianantarctic-rift-system-with-revision-of-qantassaurus-intrepidus-rich-and-vickersrich-1999/D6FEF2CD3EC1CAAD8F41B6ED73EC356C#">3</a>]</sup>.
                The cretaceous period
                was around 141 - 65 million years ago. Meaning
                that at one point, Antarctica had vegetation,
                and was a habitual land of grass instead of snow,
                or Australia was a barren snow filled land in which those who have evolved to live in snow
                may live in. Leaellynasaura may have traveled in groups or packs, it is common for
                herbivores to travel in groups as it protects them from predators, as predators can only
                hunt one or two at a time <sup>[<a
                        href="https://australian.museum/learn/dinosaurs/fact-sheets/leaellynasaura-amicagraphica/">1</a>]</sup>.
                The predators of Leaellynasaura were Australovenators, as they also lived in australia. They
                were found to be only a bit bigger than a Leaellynasaura, making it around 5-6 meters. <sup>[<a

            <h2>Fossil and Identification</h2>
            <p>With sharp claws and teeth, the
                Leaellynasaura was a beaked dinosaur with a
                long, big and slender tail. The beak
                connected to the snout, which made it look
                like lips and it had an arched neck. Its legs
                were long, great for running and short arms
                that it kept close to its body. A three toed
                dinosaur with another at its heel. Not much is
                known about the color of the dinosaur, but one
                thing for sure is that it had some sort of
                feathers or fur, good for protecting against
                pests, insects, and a fatal wound. The fossil
                had a toothed maxilla, skull roof, large eye
                sockets, and an endocast on the brain. An
                endocast is a hollow part of the brain

            <h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
            <p>A very common cretaceous dinosaur that roamed
                the lower latitudes of earth. They created
                burrows and possibly hibernated during winter.
                In order to hibernate, they must store food. The
                Leaellynasaura ate edible and low growing plants,
                such as horse horsetails and ferns. Food was
                necessary for them during the winter, as there
                would be no more plants that could survive the
                winters. Which is why they communicated using
                their voice and body language. To either warn
                the others or tell them that food or a water hole
                was near <sup>[<a

            <p>From an egg, a Leaellynasaura hatches in a
                den or burrow <sup>[<a href="https://dinosaurpictures.org/Leaellynasaura-pictures">5</a>]</sup>.
                There on
                out, they follow
                their parent, as they are responsible for
                making sure the newly hatched Leaellynasaura
                is able to survive on its own. Their skeletal
                structure showed that in 5-7 years, the
                Leaellynasaura would reach maturity and leave
                their parents. It’s said that the first 2-3
                years, they grow faster, but slow down
