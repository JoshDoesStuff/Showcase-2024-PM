            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to the Jurassic Park Wiki, the Carnotaurus had spiked scale armor laid across the body, and theThey had an incredibly muscular neck and set of shoulder blades, but had very short arms, with long andpowerfully built legs. Carnotaurus had a small skull, and on that skull, they had very distinct,bull-like horns. Carnotaurus is well known for being colored red, with black markings covering theirupper body, with a creme colored underbelly.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>According to the Jurassic Word Evolution Wiki, Carnotaurus lived in what is now Argentina in La ColoniaFormation. This is a tropical/subtropical environment with forests, rivers and floodplains. The DinosaurMadness website states that within Argentina, at least at the time of the Carnotaurus, the temperaturesranged between 68 F to 86 F.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>According to an article from the Daily Mail UK, a Carnotaurus fossil was identified by it’s incrediblysmall forelimbs, and long thin hind limbs. The skeleton was preserved with impressions of their skin,showing a mosaic-like layout of various small scales, covering the skeleton. Only one Carnotaurusskeleton has been found, but because it’s one whole skeleton, we know a lot about this dinosaur.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>According to Six Flags, New England, they lived around Patagonia, Argentina. Since there has only beenone Carnotaurus fossil found, all we know is that the Carnotaurus for sure lived in the humid climate ofArgentina. The reason that only one Carnotaurus fossil has been found is unknown.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>According to The Daily Mail UK and Six Flags New England, the first and only Carnotaurus specimen wasdiscovered by Jose Bonaparte in Argentina, in the year 1984. The bones of the Carnotaurus werefossilized in a way that showed imprints of the Carnotaurus’ scale textured skin. The skin consisted oflarge and randomly distributed conical studs surrounded by a network of small elongated, diamond-shapedor sub-circular scales.'</p>

            <h2>Time Period (Era) it Lived in and Examples of Contemporaries</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to Six Flags, New England, the Carnotaurus lived around 72 million years ago during theMaastrichtian Period in the late Cretaceous period. Carnotaurus lived alongside snakes, turtles, andearly mammals. They also lived alongside larger predators such as the Mapusaurus. According to the LaColonia Formation Wiki, Carnotaurus also lived with species of Plesiosaurs, Mammals, AbelisauridaeAnkylosauria, Hadrosauroidea, Somphospondyli, and Theropoda.</p>

            <h2>Feeding and Diet</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to the Jurassic Park Wiki, because the Carnotaurus had a small skull with a weak bite force, they probably couldn’t have hunted and eaten large creatures alone. Instead they tookadvantage of their long, muscular legs, that they used to overpower smaller, prey like Sauropodsand Ankylosaurus’. Despite their small head, their jaws were able to open up very wide, comparedto other Theropod dinosaurs, which further assisted them in the pursuit of smaller prey.According to Six Flags, New England, the Carnotaurus ate snakes, turtles, and even earlymammals, which gave them a very rich diet when compared to other Theropods. Also since theycouldn’t take down large prey that looked like the North American Brachiosaurus, they hunted insmall packs.</p>

            <h2>Behaviors and Adaptations</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to extinctanimals.org, the Carnotaurus was one of the fastest predators in the Mesozoic Era,that was able to gulp down some of the animals it preyed on, in one bite, making the Carnotaurus a verythreatening predator.</p>

                <p>According to Jurassic-Pedia, the Carnotaurus wasn’t the most fond of company, so they could be seen insmall groups, and were often solitary. They use their horns to recognize each other by the differencesin their horn shapes. When in a group of around 2-3, they would travel, in defense of territory andduring hunts. After a failed attempt at a hunt or territorial attack, a non-dominant animal may attemptto take over as the dominant one, by moving to the front of the group to travel in a display ofdominance.</p>

                <p>Other hunting behaviors include assembling bones of animals they have killed into these nest liketerritory markers, making this an advertisement of their skill.</p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>According to Jurassic-Pedia, to communicate, the Carnotaurus vocalizes with low rumbling roars andbass-like howls, and might produce loud cries to intimidate potential prey or communicate with others ofits kind. When socializing with an animal of the same kind, the Carnotaurus utilizes the horns on its head, asvisual signals that can also play a role while in combat with another Carnotaurus, as rivals shove andhead-but each other, similar to how male kangaroos fight with each other to assert dominance. The hornscould act as a structure to absorb shock of blows to the head of the Carnotaurus, with the neck beinghighly muscular to further enhance the dinosaur’s combative ability.</p>
