            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Archaeopteryx, discovered in 1863 by Richard Owen, was one of the first animals to fly upon the
                planet. Living in the Mesozoic Era (255-66 million years ago), it was briefly believed to have been the
                first animal to fly, until the soon-after discovery of other prehistoric birds in northern China,
                Argentina, and Chile.  Some other winged dinosaurs discovered to have existed in the same time as
                the Archaeopteryx are Heperornis regalis and Ichthyornis dispar.<sup><a href="#Source-01">1</a></sup>

                    <h2>Food and Diet</h2>
                    <p>The Archaeopteryx had a diet that consisted mainly of other small<br> creatures and animals. It
                        was a
                        carnivore, so it preyed on fish, small<br> amphibians, reptiles, smaller mammals, and insects.
                        Although
                        it
                        had<br> wings, it used them only for gliding, and could not sustain flight like most <br>modern
                        birds.
                        It
                        used this gliding to scout out prey, dive into water to<br> catch fish, and swoop in to grab
                        smaller
                        animals
                        it found. While the<br> Archaeopteryx had a seemingly large array of prey, it was not the top of
                        the<br>
                        food chain, however. It was a target prey for numerous land and ground dinosaurs.</p>

                    <h2>Habitat</h2>
                    <p>The Archaeopteryx is found to have inhabited much of what is modern<br> day Bavaria, Germany
                        (South-East
                        Germany). During the times of the<br> Archaeopteryx, Europe was much closer to the equator,
                        laying
                        at
                        about<br> the same latitude as modern day Florida. It thrived in a warm and dry climate,
                        <br>full of
                        rivers
                        and forests where it caught most of its prey. Unlike nearly all modern<br> birds, the
                        Archaeopteryx
                        is
                        not
                        believed to have ever made nests in<br> or lived in trees, despite the fact it laid eggs like
                        modern
                        birds.</p>

                    <h2>Discovered</h2>
                    <p>The Archaeopteryx was originally discovered in 1861 in Germany,<br> where a feather was found.
                        Shortly after, in 1863, a more complete<br> fossil of the bird's skeleton was discovered in the
                        Bavaria region<br> of Germany by Richard Owen.</p>

                    <p>The prehistoric “bird” had black feathers and small wings <br>used for gliding. It also had a
                        bony tail
                        which<br> it used for stability; only three fingers with deadly claws at the<br> ends, and a
                        beak full
                        of
                        many sharp teeth. Unlike most modern<br> birds, it did not eat seeds, but rather other small
                        animals and
                        fish.<br> The Archaeopteryx was relatively small for a dinosaur - ranging<br> from about the
                        size of a
                        blue-jay or crow - up to the size of a chicken.</p>
