        <section class="sixty">

            <h2>Scale</h2>
            <p> The average size of the Triceratops was around 9 meters long. Their head made up around one
                third
                of their body, its range was about 10 meters long.
            </p>

            <h2>Habitat</h2>

            <p>The Triceratops tended to live in dry, forested areas and plains with plenty of vegetation.
                Due to them being herbivores, they need plants to survive instead of meat like carnivores.
                Their ecosystems were heavily forested, and much more different than they are in the present
                day. To find out about the climate and environment in a certain period of time, scientists use
                the remaining stone around the fossils to determine what it was like in the prehistoric times.
            </p>

            <h2>Distribution</h2>

            <p>
                Triceratops fossils are mostly found in North America, in the United States. Fossils were
                located in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, and a few were in Canada. In fact, the
                first recorded fossil was found near Denver, Colorado, meaning that back in the late
                Cretaceous period North America was filled with vegetation and forests, due to the lack of
                human interference. There is no information on if triceratops fossils are somewhere other
                than the United States, the act of fossilization, or an animal becoming preserved in a
                fossilized form, occurs at specialized sites where remnants of bones are to be encased in
                the surrounding rocks.
            </p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <p>
                The Triceratops, whose Latin name translates to “three-horned face,” is one of the most
                recognized of every dinosaur, due to its familiar frill and horns. Along their frill,
                they possessed a quantity of small spikes that are called epoccipitals, and usually had
                around 19-26 of them. The Triceratops had a beak-like mouth that helped with tough
                vegetation and an abnormally large head that was around 10 feet long, making it one of
                the largest animals to ever roam the Earth.
            </p>

            <h2>Feeding and Diet</h2>
            <p>
                Triceratops were herbivores, feeding on low vegetation. Scientists can determine
                this by taking a closer look at their teeth. Since their teeth are more flattened,
                it made it easier to grind plant matter, therefore showing that they had a diet of
                plants in the surrounding area. The Triceratops most likely feasted on ferns, cycads
                and palms due to these plants being in abundance in the heavily forested areas.

            <h2>Behaviors and Adaptations</h2>

            <p>
                Triceratops most likely battled amongst themselves, as shown by injuries that
                were caused by other Triceratops. Puncture marks on frills suggested that male
                triceratops used their horns when fighting each other, possibly to impress
                females. Frills with holes in them were discovered and showed signs of healing,
                the fighting between Triceratops were most likely due to the battle over
                territory or breeding.
            </p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>

            <p>
                Triceratops most likely traveled alone most of their lives, rather than
                traveling in herds like other animals. Remains of Triceratops were often
                found spread out, they were rarely found in groups of 3 or more individual
                triceratops. Even though they may have traveled alone, they still fought
                amongst themselves over territory and mates.
            </p>

            <h2>Life History Cycle</h2>

            <p>
                They usually grew up to 8 to 9 meters long and weighed around 5 to 9
                metric tons. The largest skull of a Triceratops was estimated to have
                been 2.5 meters, or 8.2 feet, in length, making up around one third of
                the length of the entire body. The Triceratops was one of the largest
                dinosaurs in body mass.
            </p>

            <h2>Breeding Behaviors</h2>

            <p>
                Male Triceratops left their family groups during reproductive season to find
                mates. They may have herded male rivals away from potential mates or
                competed against other males. Their frill might have been lined with
                blood vessels that help change the color of it to communicate
                danger, anger, or receptiveness to mate.
            </p>

            <h2>Predators</h2>

            <p>
                It is believed that the Tyrannosaurus preyed upon triceratops,
                due to them living in the same time period. A Triceratops fossil
                was found with a bitten off horn with bite marks that match a
                Tyrannosaurus rex. It is most likely that their horns helped to
                fend off attacks from the Tyrannosaurus.
            </p>

            <h2>Fossil Description</h2>

            <p>
                Triceratops hind limbs were larger than their forelimbs, but
                overall both sets were stout. The skull of the Triceratops
                had frill on the back of it and had a beak that was in front
                of the teeth. The 3 horns on the skull of the Triceratops
                most likely acted as defensive weapons to protect themselves
                from danger.
            </p>
