                        The irritator was a generalist when it came to what types
                        of animals were part of their diet. Based on the mouth
                        shape and location, they primarily ate fish, turtles and smaller dinosaurs. It’s
                        believed that they acted crocodilian in nature.

                        would
                        help the irritator move its head quickly and pull its jaw against water.
