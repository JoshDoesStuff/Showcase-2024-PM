            <p>The Dilophosaurus was around on average 8m (23ft), weighing in at about 400 kg (880lbs), and had a skull
                around 24in. It was slender and built lightly for quick movement, and was the largest land animal
                predator at its time. Its size is comparable to that of a brown bear or polar bear.<sup>[<a

                    <p>Dilophosaurus lived in what is now Arizona, and during its life it is predicted that the
                        environment
                        was warm and wet seasonally, with dry sand dunes coming and going. The average temperature in
                        the
                        Jurassic period was around 5-10°C warmer than it is today, with 4x the amount of carbon dioxide
                        in
                        the atmosphere. The excess carbon dioxide resulted in these warmer temperatures because of its
                        greenhouse effect.<sup>[<a href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup></p>

                        three fossils have only been found in this region up until now, Dilophosaurus may have lived in

                <p>The Dilophosaurus lived in the early Jurassic period, which began at the end of the Triassic period
                    around 201 million years ago, and ended at the beginning of the Middle Jurassic period, around 175
                    million years ago. Dinosaurs that lived at the same time as the Dilophosaurus include Ammosaurus,
                    Barapasaurus, Kotasaurus, Lesothosaurus, Lophostropheus, Sarcosaurus, Vulcanodon, and Yunnanosaurus.

            <p>The dilophosaurus was the apex predator of the Early Jurassic period, there were no animals that were

            <p>The Dilophosaurus was extremely active and bipedal. Its legs were very powerful and the dilophosaurus was
                capable of fast running, and it had a strong tail as well. The Dilophosaurus’ pelvis was somewhat weak,
                at first being interpreted as an adaptation for a life in the water, but the strength and proportions of
                its body didn’t point to an aquatic lifestyle. Now, the widely accepted theory was that the
                Dilophosaurus used its strong tail to bounce on while attacking an enemy, like how a kangaroo
                does.<sup>[<a href="#Source-06">6</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>Very little is known about the breeding behavior of the dilophosaurus, but it is assumed that one
                    reason
                    for the two crests on top of its head was for attracting mates. As most reptiles do, the
                    dilophosaurus
                    reproduces by laying eggs, and they hatch into a juvenile dilophosaurus, then growing up into an
                    adult.<sup>[<a href="#Source-07">7</a>]</sup>

            <p>The Dilophosaurus was approximately 7m (23ft) in length, with a skull at around 2ft. It had 10 neck
                vertebrae, 14 back vertebrae, and 45 tail vertebrae. Its large hind legs allowed it to move quickly and
                catch prey effectively.<sup>[<a href="#Source-08">8</a>]</sup></p>

                    Luckily,
                    the third fossil had an intact skull, so paleontologist named Charles L. Camp came to excavate
                    shortly
                    after in 1942 and could construct a
