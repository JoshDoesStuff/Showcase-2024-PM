                <p>
                    The Corythosaurus, or more specifically, the Corythosaurus Casuarius, was a Herbivorous Dinosaur
                    that
                    lived around 77-78 million years ago.<sup>[<a href="#Source-01">1</a>]</sup> Most of them lived in
                    what is now West America, but remains
                    have been found in other places. Its name was derived from the Greek word κόρυς, which means helmet.

                        Based on its skeletal structure, the Corythosaurus was bipedal, (Stood upright and walked on
                        two legs), and used its tail as a balance while getting food from trees. <sup>[<a
                                href="#Source-02">2</a>]</sup> The Corythosaurus
                        often traveled in groups in order to protect themselves from predators. If a danger got too
                        close to the group, a warning call would be sent to the other members of the group.<sup>[<a
                                href="#Source-03">3</a>]</sup>
                        As for reproduction, the Corythosaurus had a Oviparous birth, or they hatched out of eggs.
                        <sup>[<a href="#Source-03">3</a>]</sup>
                        In order to successfully mate, they need a partner. Presumably, the Corythosaurus used their
                        hollow crest to make a noise in hopes of attracting a partner.<sup>[<a
                                href="#Source-04">4</a>]</sup> The time it takes for the
                        Corythosaurus to mature is unknown, but their average lifespan is estimated to be around 65
                        years.

                        The only 2 known predators to the Corythosaurus were the Gorgosaurus Libratus and an unnamed
                        species of Daspletosaurus.<sup>[<a href="#Source-05">5</a>]</sup> The Gorgosaurus is a member of
                        the Tryannasourids family, and is
                        as dangerous as the T-Rex. For more information on the Gorgosaurus, please navigate to <a

                                1911.<sup>[<a href="#Source-06">6</a>]</sup>
                                The first
                                fossil was found in the Red Deer River of Alberta.<sup>[<a
                                        href="#Source-06">6</a>]</sup> This find was very interesting
                                because
                                there was most of the skeleton intact, some impressions of skin was still there as well.

                                The Corythosaurus mostly lived in what is currently West America, but many others lived
                                all over
                                North America. There were often groups living in what is now Montana (US), and Alberta
                                (Canada).<sup>[<a href="#Source-03">3</a>]</sup> Since the Corythosaurus was a
                                Herbivore, their habitat was mostly made of
                                trees and
                                other vegetation.
